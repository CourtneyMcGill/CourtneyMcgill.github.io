    <h1 class= 'centerHeader'>  ABOUT </h1>
      <p class = 'bio'> 
        I'm a machine learning engineer in New York City. <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I graduated from Colgate University in 2016 with a BA in Computer Science and Sociology. I spent my summers in college interning at the Philadelphia Phillies, taking classes at Bogazici University in Turkey, and working as a Software Engineer on the Cloud Professional Services team at HP inc. <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I discovered my love of data science and machine learning when I joined the Clearance and Collateral Technology team at Bank of New York Mellon after graduation. I realized that life can't get much better than spending your days exploring data, coding, and doing math. <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In my free time you can catch me exploring the NYC with my friends, building inventions with my Ardunio Uno, or traveling the world (I've visted to 14 countries since graduation)!<br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I'm passionate about increasing the presence of underrepresnted groups in technology and am always open to volunteering for related causes.<br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I am available for speaking engagements & panels, so shoot me an email or reach out on linkedin.
